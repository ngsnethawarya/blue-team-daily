# Blue Team Daily
This repository documents small, daily Blue Team learning notes and experiments.
Each entry focuses on a single defensive security concept, log analysis idea,
or lightweight script used in lab environments.

Goal: build consistency, reinforce fundamentals, and create a visible learning trail.
